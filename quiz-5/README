The next killer app is going to be this website that checks if the sentence you enter into a box is a pangram.

We had a developer who started on it, but they didn't do a very good job, and now they've left to work at Facebook. We
need you to clean up their code and finish where they left off.

The HTML and CSS are pretty much done, but they are badly formatted, don't follow standards, and the HTML has some issue
that is preventing the page from working properly. See if you can find the issue and make the HTML and CSS code look
better.

The JavaScript is where most of the work is left to do. When a user types a sentence and clicks "GO", it should add
a box underneath the form that says "This sentence is a pangram!" or "This sentence is not a pangram!". The JavaScript
is partially complete already, but needs some additional code to function properly, as well as formatting and logic
clean up.

You are encouraged to make the page as visually appealing as you want, so feel free to change colors, fonts, or spacing.
But remember, at Commerce House we love beautiful code just as much as beautiful websites, so show us how well you can
format, organize, and clean up code.
